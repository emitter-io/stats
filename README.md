# Emitter Stats
This golang package is used for monitoring emitter.io cluster. This provides a tight binary compression and a single histogram/counter abstraction in order to deal with various kinds of system monitoring. This package is compatible with GopherJS (snapshot-only) and hence can also be compiled to javascript.
